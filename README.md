# Land and Buildings Transaction Tax Calculator
This project is a console application for calculating LBTT or stamp duty on property bought in the UK. Unit Testing is also carried out for different house prices.

Buying a house in the UK incurs a tax which varies according to the price of the house and circumstances of the purchaser e.g. a higher rate is paid if you are buying a second home. In Scotland this is called Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT), but you may know it as Stamp Duty (The equivalent tax in England). 

Calculating LBTT can be complex due to the different rules that apply when buying a property hence for simplicity we assume:
* The buyer of the house currently owns a property and lives in it as their main residence 
* The buyer does not conduct any kind of business activity from their house i.e. it is purely for personal use 
* The buyer does not own any other properties 
* At the end of the purchase the buyer will still only own one house i.e. they intent to sell their current home at the same date they buy the new one
